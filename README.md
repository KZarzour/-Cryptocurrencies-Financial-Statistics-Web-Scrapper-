Cryptocurrencies Financial Statistics Web Scrapper using Python selenium and beautifulsoup4 libraries 

Trying out Web Scraping

Currently the Python Script goes to https://www.cryptocompare.com , runs the javascript code on the page with selenium and gets the information as the html using beautifulsoup, after working on the strings to turn them into integer values that are put into a Pandas Dataframe for later use. The script then outputs the data to a CSV file, the goal is to use it later on to do some Data Visualization this will be implemented later.
